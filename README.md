Basic Entity Game Design in C++

First version of a simple platform game developed in MS Windows. The new version is still in progress but in Android C++ via Java Native Interface (JNI). Not a horizontal platform anymore but a top-down space-shoter.

Modification, improvements and new source will be release asap.
